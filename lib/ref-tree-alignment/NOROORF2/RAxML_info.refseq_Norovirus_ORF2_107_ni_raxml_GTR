IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences 43 and 44 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 sequence that is exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates removed is printed to file refseq_Norovirus_ORF2_107_ni_aln.reduced
